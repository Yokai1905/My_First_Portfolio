                <p>The goal here was to find an already existing logo we weren't fully on board with and look for ideas on how to change it, thinking about the differnt type of logos that exist and choose the most fitting. This project was done primatly on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                <h3>Project 2: Jidari poster</h3>
                <p>Jidari is a yearly festival celebrated in Rabat centered around Street Art. My task was to look at some of the examples of promotional posters made for this festival and realize one of my own, ideally evocative of Morocco, hence the animal choice.</p>

        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm passionate about art and all the different forms it can take. I'm also more specifically interested on graphic design, as it applies art in an specially paritucular way, centered around playing subtly with colors, typography and placement of objects to explain so much about a brand or product without having to use much, if any, words. I am also passionate about internet and internet culture, as well as the world of web design and development. I intend to enter both the world of graphic design, UI/UX Design and web development. Some the skills I'm working on are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML and CSS</li>
                <li>Illustration and drawing</li>
                <li>Version Control with Git and GitHub</li>
                <li>Adobe Suite programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Xd, among others.</li>
